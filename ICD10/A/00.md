## General Despcription
Cholera is caused by the infection of toxigenic *Vibrio cholerae*, a gram negative rod-like bacteria. Severe cholera can be deadly.

Main symptoms are diarreah and vomiting resulting in fluid loss and electrolyte loss. Fever and abdominal pains are rare.

Main manegement is volume repletion with isotonic fluids. Antibodies and antibiotics are also useful.

## Etiology
Cholera is caused by the infection of toxigenic <span class="causeMO">*Vibrio cholerae*</span>. After passing the upper gastro-intestinal tract, *V.cholerae* colonises in the <span class="loc">small intestine</span>. Here, toxigenic *V.bacteria* produces a toxin named cholera toxin. 

Cholera toxin consists of 6 subunits, a single A-subunit and 5 B-subunits. Cholera toxin is endocytosed into the epithelial cell, where the disulfide bond between A-subunit and B-subunits are cleaved.<br>
The five B-subunits causes the endocytosis of the cholera toxin. The B-subunits give cholera toxin a high affinity with monosialoganglioside GM1, a epithelial cell surface receptor.<br>
The single A-subunit causes cAMP increase via Gs protein after it is cleaved from the B-subUnits. This increase results in chloride secretion and inhibition of sodium absorption, causing the fluid loss.

## Epidemiology
The estimated number of global annual cases is <span id="nGCases">3000000</span> to 5000000[6] with <span id="nGDeaths">100000</span> global annual deaths.

Cholera is endemic mostly in Africa and Asia with occasional epidemic spreads[1](#sources).

### In Japan
